**TERMS**
MAX:    The number determining the dimensions of the map.
***************************************************************************************************************
**DEFINITIONS**
Bank Account:
This contains the Hero’s Whiffles. Operations on a Bank Accounts consist of
displaying, decrementing and incrementing its balance. A bank account balance
should always be zero or more. Because one Whiffle is the smallest denomination
in the Frupal Economy, a Bank Account balance is always a whole number.

Binoculars:
Binoculars allow you to increase the distance of your vision and cost 50Wh.

Boat:
When in the Hero’s possession, it allows the traversal of Map Cells containing water
with no loss of energy. Boats cost 250Wh.

Clue:
A hint to the location of the Royal Diamonds. The clue may be true or may not. If it
is true, everything in the clue is true, but if it is false, everything in the clue is false.
A clue has the general format of “You are w from the western border, you possess
more than x Whiffles, and the Royal Diamonds are located y to the east and z to the
South.” Clues cost 25Wh.

Energy Balance:
This maintains a measure of the level of energy the Hero has available in units of
Energy Points. If the balance ever drops to zero or less, the Hero dies. Operations
on the energy balance consist of displaying, decrementing and incrementing its
value. The energy balance is an Integer value.

Game Map:
This is the virtual space within which the Hero travels. Conceptually, it consists of a
number of adjacent, addressable “Map Cells” that can contain tools, obstacles,
treasure chests, etc. A Map Cell can also conceptually contain the Hero if the Hero’s
location is the address of the specific Map Cell. See Appendix A – Game Map Details
and Specification.

Game State:
The game state contains all the values necessary to represent a specific game
instantiation at a particular point in play. Namely, the contents of all the Map cells,
the visibility state of all the Map Cells, the Hero’s location, the Hero’s Bank Account
Balance, the Hero’s Energy Balance and the Hero’s Item Inventory.

Hero:
The player’s alter ego in the Game. The player causes the Hero to make certain
moves and take certain actions.
